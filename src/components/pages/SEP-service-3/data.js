export const SERVICE_3_DESCRIPTION = `The parameters that can be selected are:
a specific NUTS region and/or a specific municipality within it, both Italian and French;
a specific age group (for example from 80 to 85 years) to display only the value of the population of that specific age group.
In the map the NUTS3 regions and the selected municipalities will be highlighted. Inside it, the different pollutant registration stations are highlighted. 
The map is interactive: when you hover the cursor on the region of interest, the name of the NUTS3 region and the population value of the specific group selected is shown. 
In a tabular view, you will be able to view and compare French and Italian data relating to the population and air pollution related to PM10.
The table data can be further analyzed with the external tools Cube visualizer and Olap Browser.
With this service it is possible to observe, for example, in which regions the most vulnerable population groups are most at risk from pollution.`;
