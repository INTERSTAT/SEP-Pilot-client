export const SERVICE_1_DESCRIPTION = `The user can choose to select a specific Country, between Italy and France, to be analyzed. It is possible to view two different information: the first allows to highlight the Municipalities with higher pollution, in which the average value measured by all the stations in the selected municipality is calculated, in relation to the pollutant PM 10, in the year 2019.
This service relates both the pollution data and the census data, which highlight the value of the resident population in the municipality divided by age and gender.
In addition, information specific to the PM10 pollutant considered in the analysis is reported.
The second table allows, instead, to obtain the municipalities with higher resident population and also the age group and gender whose value is greater, in relation to the pollution data in the specific municipality.
In this service, which represents a specific cross-domain analysis for the selected Country, the areas where people live better thanks to less air pollution are highlighted or, vice versa, where they live worse; it is also possible to do an analysis on the population density in those areas.`;
