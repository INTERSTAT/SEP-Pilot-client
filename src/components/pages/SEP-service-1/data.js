export const SERVICE_1_DESCRIPTION = `The user can select a specific Country, between Italy and France, to be analysed. It is possible to view two different types of information: the first one allows to highlight the Municipalities with higher pollution level, based on the average value measured by all the stations in the selected municipality. This service linking pollution and census data, highlights the value of the resident population in the Municipality grouped by age and gender. In addition, specific information related to the PM10 pollutant considered in the analysis, is reported. The second table allows, instead, to obtain the Municipalities with higher resident population and also the age group and gender whose value is greater, in relation to the pollution data in the selected Municipality. In this service, which represents a specific cross-domain analysis for the selected Country, the areas with the highest or the lowest levels of air pollution, are highlighted. It is also possible to do an analysis on the resident population in those areas.`;
