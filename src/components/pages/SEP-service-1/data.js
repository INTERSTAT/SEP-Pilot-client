export const SERVICE_1_DESCRIPTION = `The map (for example the Italian one) highlights the NUTS3 regions in which one or more municipalities have verified an overrun of the maximum air quality threshold, with reference to the air pollutant PM 10, in the year 2019.  The user can choose to select a specific country, between Italy and France, to be analyzed. \r\n The map is interactive: you can pass the mouse over the stations concerned and it shows data such as the NUTS3 and the population value or also the municipality where the station is located and the specific value of the pollutant measured.  In this map, which represents a specific cross-domain analysis for Italy, the areas where people live better thanks to less air pollution are also highlighted and it is thus possible to make an analysis on the population density in those areas.  The table shows the numerical values ​​instead.  The table data can be further analyzed with the external tools Cube visualizer and Olap Browser.`;
